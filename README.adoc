# SUN Framebuffer Logos

:imagesdir: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1k5/sun-fb-logos/main/


This repository contains SUN framebuffer logos, i.e., the logos you see when
booting a SPARCstation, Ultra, or other SUN machine.  Unless mentioned
otherwise, these are pixel-exact copies of the logos taken straight from the
firmware.

NOTE:  If the colors don't look right, it may be a browser problem.  E.g., on
firefox I had to set `gfx.color_management.mode = 0` in `about:config`.  The
colors in the images are _exactly_ right, so just use a proper image viewer
instead of a browser.


How to Help
-----------
If you have any framebuffers with logos you don't see on this page, you can
help me out by sending me their firmware.  All you need is a serial connection
to your SUN computer.  I wrote a little link:HOWTO.adoc[HOWTO] document
explaining the process.


The Logos
---------

Original
~~~~~~~~
This is the old logo as seen when booting a SUN-3 or early SPARCstation.  If
you have a color framebuffer, e.g., a CG3, the logo is drawn in `sun-blue`
(that's exactly `#6441b4`.)

CG6

CG14 / SX
~~~~~~~~~
The CG14 / SX has three logos that are shown at random.

TCX / FSV

RasterFlex-HR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The RasterFlex-HR FCode (firmware) contains the image's pixel data but no
reference to a color map.  I have constructed an 8-bit color map using (3,3,2)
bits for (r,g,b) in the usual way.  The result looks right to me, though I
can't say whether the colors are _exactly_ right.

XVR-100

SPARCbook 3
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the large logo that the SPARCbook 3 shows when powered on.  I have not yet
found the smaller version of the logo that is shown above the banner.
